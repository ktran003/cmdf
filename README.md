# Budget Buddies - cmd-F 2024 

## Inspiration
Amidst the ongoing challenges of inflation and economic uncertainties, the need for financial stability and affordability has become more important than ever. Adding to this issue is the prevailing lack of financial literacy among adults, a problem rooted in the lack of financial literacy received in school. 

## What it does
Inspired to empower youths through financial literacy, Budget Buddies was created to improve financial literacy through gamified and interactive activities for youths to learn financial concepts in a digestible and concise way. 

## How we built it
We developed this mobile app on a React App, incorporating TailwindCSS for the UI framework. For authentication, we integrated 1Password's Passage API, and for the chatbot functionality, we utilized Cohere's API, specifically leveraging its chat AI feature.

## Challenges we ran into
Implementing the chatbox and learning how to use Cohere and 1Password presented challenges that we had to overcome. There was a significant amount of learning and debugging involved during this process.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
For one of our developers, it was their first time using TailwindCSS! and for both of our developers, we were proud of successfully implementing the APIs

## What we learned
During our research and conversations with friends, we found that many of us did not receive or have much knowledge about financial literacy while growing up, so the idea of developing an app to deliver these educational resources in a gamified manner seemed both innovative and beneficial.
